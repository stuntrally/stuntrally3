  - time difference and current points shown on each checkpoint
- 📃 Detailed list of tracks with:
  - 🖼️ preview image and minimap (click to toggle zoom)
  - 📊 stats like: rating, difficulty, length, width, jumps, loops, pipes, obstacles and much more
  - Driveability % estimate for vehicle on track (low means unfit)

Game and editor both have few different tools for in *command line*.  
These tools can check tracks, warnings, challenges, convert track ghost etc.  
For details, start game or editor in console,  
with command line argument `?` or `help` to get their text info.  
Or see under Args::Help() in sources for [game](../src/game/SceneInit.cpp) and [editor](../src/editor/SceneInit.cpp).

- In game vehicle editor
  - allows faster tinkering with simulation parameters, collision, etc
  - aids creating new ones, page [here](VehicleEditing.md)
- Many graphs (visualizations) of key simulation values
  - gearbox and torque curve, suspension, differentials etc
